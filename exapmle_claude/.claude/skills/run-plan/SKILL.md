# Run Plan — Implementation Plan executor

> **Take an approved Implementation Plan and drive it to reviewed code: implement per the DAG, gate
> with architecture-reviewer + plan-verifier, and resolve their comments in a bounded fix loop.**

You are the **orchestrator**, running in the main session. The spec and the plan already exist and
were approved by a human beforehand (you run `spec-creator` and `implementation-planner` separately —
they are **not** part of this command). You do **not** implement or review yourself — you dispatch the
specialized agents and keep only their short final reports in context, so your context stays lean and
cheap. Spawn agents with the `Agent` tool; run independent agents **concurrently** (multiple tool
calls in one message).

## Inputs (args)

| Token | Meaning | Default |
|-------|---------|---------|
| `plan:<path>` | Path to the approved Implementation Plan. **Required.** | — |
| free-text prose | Optional notes / constraints for this run (e.g. "skip phase 3 for now"). | — |
| `mode:multi` / `mode:single` | Override the plan's Execution mode. | read from the plan |
| `max-fix:<n>` | Cap on the architecture-review fix loop (Step 3). | `3` |

If no `plan:` is given, ask for the plan path and stop — do not guess. State your interpretation of
the args in one line before starting.

## Guardrails (always)

- **Starts from a plan.** Do not author a spec or a plan here. If the plan is missing or unreadable,
  stop and say so.
- **No test-writer.** A dedicated test-authoring pass is intentionally disabled for this command.
  Coverage comes only from each implementer's self-verification (the module's existing tests +
  typecheck). Do not spawn `test-writer`.
- **Never `git push`, merge, or open a PR.** The run ends at a review-clean working tree plus a
  recommendation to run `pr-self-review`.
- **Bound the fix loop** to `max-fix` iterations. Never loop forever; if findings remain, stop and
  report them for a human.
- **Respect owned-path non-overlap** whenever you run implementers concurrently.
- **Keep context lean.** Hold the plan path and each agent's short report — never paste an agent's
  full working transcript back into your own reasoning.

## Execution algorithm

### Step 0 — Read the plan

Read the plan file. Extract for every task: `T-id`, `Action`, `Module`, `Type`, `Skills to use`,
`Owned paths`, `Depends-on`, `Known gotchas`, `Acceptance`. Read the plan's `## Execution mode`
field; a `mode:` arg overrides it. Build the dependency DAG from `Depends-on`. Print a one-line
summary of what will run (e.g. "6 tasks, multi-agent, 3 phases; fix loop max 3").

### Step 1 — Implement

**Multi-agent mode** (default when the plan says so):
1. Find the **ready set** — tasks whose `Depends-on` are all complete and whose `Owned paths` do not
   overlap any task already running this batch.
2. Spawn one **`implementer`** per ready task, **concurrently** (one message, multiple `Agent` calls).
   Give each implementer its full task block **plus the list of the other tasks' `Owned paths`** so it
   stays in its lane.
3. Wait for the batch, collect reports, mark tasks done.
4. Repeat from (1) until all tasks are complete.

**Single-agent mode:** run the tasks sequentially in plan order, one `implementer` at a time.

Each implementer self-verifies (the module's existing tests + typecheck) before returning. If one
reports **blocked / failing** and cannot fix it in scope: record it, and either dispatch a targeted
retry or surface it to the user — do not silently continue past a red task that others depend on.

### Step 2 — Review gate (parallel, read-only)

Compute the **changed-file set** (`git diff` against `origin/main`, or accumulate from the implementer
reports). Then spawn, **concurrently**:

- **`architecture-reviewer`** on the changed-file set → structural findings (severity + rule) and a
  PASS/FAIL gate.
- **`plan-verifier`** with the plan + changed set → a traceability matrix and a PASS/FAIL/REVIEW gate.

Both run on Sonnet (read-only, structured prompts). Collect both verdicts.

### Step 3 — Fix loop (bounded — this is where review comments get resolved)

Build the **fix backlog**:
- `architecture-reviewer` findings with severity **critical** or **high** (medium/low → report only).
- `plan-verifier` rows with status **missing** or **partial** (a requirement is not actually met).

If the backlog is empty → go to Step 4. Otherwise loop, for iteration `i = 1 … max-fix`:

1. **Group** findings by file / owned-path into non-overlapping fix tasks.
2. **Dispatch `implementer`(s)** — one per group, concurrent where owned paths are disjoint — each
   instructed: *"Fix exactly these findings in these files, stay in scope, self-verify."* Pass each
   finding's text, `file:line`, and the reviewer's recommendation.
3. Each fix implementer self-verifies (existing tests + typecheck).
4. **Re-review only the changed files**: re-run `architecture-reviewer` scoped to the touched files;
   re-run `plan-verifier` only for the requirements that were `missing`/`partial`.
5. Recompute the backlog:
   - empty → **break (gate PASS)**.
   - non-empty but **no progress** since last iteration (same findings unresolved) → break and flag as
     stuck for the user.
   - otherwise → continue to the next iteration.

If `max-fix` is reached with a non-empty backlog → stop and list the remaining findings for a human
decision. Never exceed the cap.

### Step 4 — Final report

Output the summary below and recommend running **`pr-self-review`** before push. Do **not** push,
merge, or open a PR. Offer to invoke `pr-self-review` as the next step.

## Output format (final report)

```
## Run Plan — <feature>

- **Plan:** `docs/plans/<feature>.md` — mode: multi-agent | single-agent
- **Implemented:** <N> tasks (T1…Tn) — <one line>
- **Self-verify:** module suites + typecheck green | failing (<detail>)

### Review gate
- architecture-reviewer (sonnet): PASS | FAIL — <crit/high counts>
- plan-verifier (sonnet): PASS | FAIL | REVIEW — <verified N/M; missing/partial ids>

### Fix loop
- iterations run: <i> / <max-fix>
- resolved: <findings fixed>
- **remaining (needs human):** <list, or "none">

### Next step
Run `pr-self-review` before pushing. (Not pushed — by design.)
```

## When you cannot proceed

If `plan:` is missing or the plan is unreadable, or an implementer is blocked on something only a
human can decide — stop and say plainly what you need. A clear "blocked here, need X" is a valid
result; a half-run pretending to be complete is not.
