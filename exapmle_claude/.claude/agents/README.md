# DevDigest Agents

Custom Claude Code subagents for the DevDigest project. Each agent is a Markdown file with YAML
frontmatter (`name`, `description`, `model`, `tools`, optional `skills:`) plus a system-prompt body.
Claude routes work to an agent based on its `description`, so the descriptions are written as
trigger rules ("Use proactively when…").

| Agent | Model | Role | Writes code? |
|-------|-------|------|--------------|
| [`researcher`](./researcher.md) | sonnet | Read-only research (project + internet), strict structured output | No |
| [`implementation-planner`](./implementation-planner.md) | opus | Read-only architect — verifies requirements and produces a structured Implementation Plan (does not author specs) | No (only the plan file) |
| [`implementer`](./implementer.md) | sonnet | Implements ONE task from a plan (backend or UI), self-verifies | Yes |
| [`test-writer`](./test-writer.md) | sonnet | Writes unit + integration tests (backend + reviewer-core + client), self-verifies | Yes |
| [`architecture-reviewer`](./architecture-reviewer.md) | sonnet | Read-only structural/architecture review of a diff or file set | No |
| [`plan-verifier`](./plan-verifier.md) | sonnet | Read-only requirements-completion / traceability check | No |
| [`doc-writer`](./doc-writer.md) | sonnet | Writes documentation (Diátaxis + Mermaid), knows where docs belong | Yes |

## Intended workflow

```
you / main session  →  agreed requirements (spec / ticket / clear request)
   └─ implementation-planner (opus, read-only) → docs/plans/<feature>.md
         (verifies requirements · recommends · asks execution mode;
          phased tasks with Type · Skills · Owned paths · Depends-on · Acceptance)
         └─ implementer(s) (sonnet) — multi-agent in parallel, or a single one-pass run
               └─ pr-self-review (existing skill) — final gate before push
```

The pipeline mirrors Claude Code's recommended **Explore → Plan → Implement → Commit** loop: the
implementation-planner runs read-only during Plan, the implementers run during Implement, and review
stays a separate fresh-context step. Requirements (the *what/why*) are an **input** to the planner —
it never authors or edits a specification.

---

## `researcher`

Pre-existing read-only research agent. Finds information inside the project or on the public
internet and returns it in a strict template. Never edits files, never runs deep-research. The
implementation-planner and implementer both follow its writing conventions (YAML frontmatter +
Hard rules + fixed output template).

---

## `implementation-planner`

**What it does.** Turns an **agreed set of requirements** (a spec, ticket, or clear request) into a
structured, file-specific **Implementation Plan** written to `docs/plans/<feature>.md`. It does
**not** author or edit specifications — requirements are an *input* it plans against. Before
planning it (1) **verifies the requirements** — restating them, flagging gaps, asking 1–4 clarifying
questions, and offering recommendations for a better approach — and (2) **asks the execution mode**:
multi-agent (parallel implementers, strictly non-overlapping `Owned paths`) or single-agent (one
linear pass). It knows every DevDigest module (`server/`, `client/`, `reviewer-core/`, `e2e/`,
`@devdigest/shared`) and assigns each task a `Type`, a skill set, owned paths, dependencies (a DAG),
known gotchas from module insights, and measurable acceptance criteria. Read-only except for the
plan file.

**Carries the full skill set.** It preloads the same skills the implementer uses (backend + UI +
core practices) plus `mermaid-diagram`, on purpose: it plans the implementation, so every practice
an implementer must follow has to be reflected in the plan.

---

## `implementer`

**What it does.** Implements exactly one task from an Implementation Plan — backend (Fastify/Drizzle/
onion) or UI (Next.js/React) — and brings it to green. Runs in parallel with other implementers on
the **same branch** (no worktree isolation), so staying inside the task's `Owned paths` is what
keeps the parallel run safe. Its self-check is narrow: write the code and make the module's existing
tests + typecheck pass; broad review is left to `pr-self-review`.

**Skill routing.** All relevant skills (backend + UI + core + always) are listed in the `skills:`
frontmatter and injected at startup, so nothing has to be invoked manually. The body just states
which set to emphasise per task `Type`.

- **Review in a fresh context, separate from the author** — [Best practices for Claude Code](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/best-practices); kept in the existing `pr-self-review` skill rather than baked into this agent

- **Module-scoped insights read before coding, written back after** — project convention in [`/CLAUDE.md`](../../CLAUDE.md) + the `engineering-insights` skill

**Deliberately not used:** `isolation: worktree` (the project runs implementers on the main branch
by choice, relying on `Owned paths` discipline instead of worktree isolation).

---

## `test-writer`

**What it does.** Adds or extends tests for the DevDigest backend (`server/`), the LLM review engine
(`reviewer-core/`), and the web client (`client/` — React components and hooks via vitest + jsdom +
React Testing Library). It enforces the project's test split (`*.it.test.ts` = real Postgres via
testcontainers with transaction-rollback isolation; `*.test.ts` = hermetic unit with fake timers and
seeded ids; client tests are always hermetic, RTL-driven, querying by accessible role/text and
mocking only I/O seams), injects a `FakeLlmProvider` at the `LLMProvider` seam for reviewer-core
tests, and never modifies production `src/` files (only a type export strictly
required to compile a test is permitted). Forbidden anti-patterns are encoded directly in its body:
tautological assertions, over-mocking, snapshot tests on dynamic output, and non-deterministic test
bodies. Self-verifies by running the affected suites and pasting terminal evidence before reporting
done.

**Skill routing.** `react-testing-library` supplies RTL and vitest query conventions; `fastify-best-practices`,
`drizzle-orm-patterns`, and `onion-architecture` anchor the backend test structure to the actual layering;
`zod` and `typescript-expert` cover schema-level assertions; `security` and `engineering-insights`
are the always-on set.

## `architecture-reviewer`

**What it does.** A **read-only** structural auditor (`tools: Read, Glob, Grep` — no `Edit`,
`Write`, or `Bash`). It audits the changed-file set the caller passes (never the whole repo) and
reads the project's authoritative docs **only for the layers that set touches** — always root
`CLAUDE.md`, plus the `server/` and/or `reviewer-core/` docs when those modules are in the set — then
checks seven named rules: inward-only dependencies,
business logic in routes, DI discipline, no `process.env` outside `LocalSecretsProvider`,
`reviewer-core` zero-I/O, `groundFindings()` gate, and shared-contract deduplication. Every finding
must cite the exact rule it violates; uncited generic opinions are suppressed. Write tools are
deliberately omitted — a reviewer that can write is tempted to fix rather than report, which destroys
review independence.

**Scope.** Does NOT review style nits, naming, runtime bugs, test quality, performance, or security
injection vectors (those belong to `pr-self-review` and the `security` skill). Structural contracts
only.

---

## `plan-verifier`

**What it does.** A **read-only** completeness checker (`tools: Read, Glob, Grep, Bash` — no
`Edit` or `Write`). Given an Implementation Plan, it walks every requirement and acceptance criterion,
searches for the concrete implementing artifact (grep → structural glob → read), quotes verbatim
evidence, and assigns one of four statuses: `done | partial | missing | cannot-verify`. `Bash` is
used only to run grep/typecheck commands and capture output as evidence — never to modify state.
After the per-requirement pass it performs an implicit-concerns sweep (error handling, auth,
idempotency, test coverage, type safety). Output is a traceability matrix table followed by a gate
verdict.

**Skill routing.** The skill set is intentionally lean: `typescript-expert` to locate TypeScript
artifacts, `onion-architecture` to know where backend artifacts should live, and
`frontend-architecture` to locate UI artifacts. No architecture-quality or security skills are
loaded — those concerns belong to `architecture-reviewer` and `pr-self-review`. The body explicitly
states this agent's mandate is completeness and traceability only.

## `doc-writer`

**What it does.** Writes and updates Markdown documentation for the DevDigest codebase. Every
claim is grounded in source (never invented); every doc is classified into a Diátaxis quadrant
(tutorial / how-to / reference / explanation) and placed according to the repo's layout decision
tree (`server/docs/`, `client/docs/`, `docs/adr/`, `docs/plans/`, `<module>/insights/`). ADRs are
append-only — accepted ones are never edited, only superseded. Every generated file is stamped with
`<!-- generated from: <source files> -->` on the second line. Mermaid diagrams are selected by
content type and validated with a post-check (unique node ids, no lowercase `end`, correct arrow
syntax) before publishing.

**Skill routing.** `mermaid-diagram` drives diagram type selection and syntax; `onion-architecture`
and `frontend-architecture` are loaded to accurately describe backend and UI module structure in
reference docs; `typescript-expert` enables accurate reading of TypeScript types and exported
symbols; `engineering-insights` closes the loop — doc-writing discoveries (undocumented constraints,
gotchas) are appended back to `<module>/insights/`.

## Adding a new agent

1. Create `<name>.md` here with frontmatter (`name`, `description`, `model`, `tools`, optional
   `skills:`).
2. Write the `description` as a trigger rule — it is the only signal Claude uses to route to the agent.
3. If you preload skills, make sure none of them set `disable-model-invocation: true` (that blocks
   preloading).
4. Add a row to the table above and a section here, with sources if the design is based on external
   practices.
